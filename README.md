# jacob-ian's Dotfiles

This is my personal development environment. I think it's pretty kickass.

Currently using alacritty rather than kitty. Kitty was having some font issues and I can't hide the titlebar on mac.

## Installation

### macOS

1. Install homebrew
2. `brew install neovim`
3. `brew install --cask alacritty`
4. `brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts`
5. `brew install --cask font-jetbrainsmono-nerd-font`
